# ADA 2023 Project â€” Team statsquad3
This is the repository for the group project in the context of the Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL. 


Abstract: Our project consists of analysis based on the positivity score of wikipedia pages. Indeed, wikipedia pages are supposed to be neutral, however they are still written by human, who will sometimes unintentionally create a positive or negative bias. The first step is therefore to assign a positivity score to each of the wikipedia page in the dataset. This is done with the use of ?InsertDataset?.
The goal is then to see if this positivity (conciously or unconciously) influences how people play the game. From the article ?Insert article name?, we know that most of the path created by plays are sementically related.
